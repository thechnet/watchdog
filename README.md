# Watchdog

## Introduction

*Watchdog* aims to become a C library that automatically warns developers of memory leaks, buffer overflows, memory corruption, and dangling pointers present in their code. Additionally, the library will narrow down the crash site on segmentation faults, compare the real memory usage to the allocated amount of memory, and offer manual bounds checking tools.

- One of the main design goals with this library is seamlessness. Therefore, most of its functionality is enabled automatically by simply including the `watchdog.h` header.
- Watchdog significantly impacts your program's performance and greatly increases its memory usage. It should therefore only be enabled in debug builds.
- This project is built from scratch, but not without prior knowledge. I am basing a lot of its functionality on [`memdbg`](https://github.com/thechnet/une/blob/main/src/util/memdbg.c), a similar but less powerful module used during development of my interpreted programming language, [*Une*](https://github.com/thechnet/une).
